# Project: Health Insights App

## About Me
- Product manager building my first iOS app
- Limited technical experience

## Goals
1. Build the app
2. Learn software development process
3. Learn (through doing) how to best collaborate with tools such as Claude Code

## How to Help Me
- Explain concepts in plain language
- Walk through steps clearly
- Answer "tangential" questions - I'm here to learn
- Tell me when something is optional/nice-to-know vs critical
- Proactively handle git commits - don't wait for me to ask

## Development Philosophy
Start with an MVP proof-of-concept that does all the technical things needed with the smallest number of inputs/outputs. Build with an architecture that is compatible with and extensible to a fuller product later. Prove the system works end-to-end first, then expand.

## The App
- Reads wearable data from Apple HealthKit
- Sends data to an LLM
- Displays personalized health recommendations

## Tech Stack
- iOS (SwiftUI)
- HealthKit API
- LLM backend (TBD)
